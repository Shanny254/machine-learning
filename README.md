# 📊 Child Mortality Rates in Kenya

## 📝 Project Overview
This project analyzes child mortality rates in Kenya using real-world data. The goal is to uncover patterns, trends, and key factors affecting child survival rates, providing valuable insights for policymakers, researchers, and health organizations.

## 🔑 Key Findings
- 📉 **Declining Trend**: Over the years, child mortality rates in Kenya have been decreasing due to improved healthcare services and immunization programs.
- 🏥 **Healthcare Access Matters**: Regions with better healthcare facilities report lower child mortality rates, while rural areas still struggle with high infant deaths.
- 💧 **Sanitation & Clean Water**: Lack of clean drinking water and proper sanitation is a significant contributor to child mortality, especially in informal settlements.
- 🍽️ **Nutrition & Maternal Health**: Malnutrition and poor maternal health significantly impact infant survival rates.
- 🚸 **Education Impact**: Higher maternal education levels correlate with lower child mortality rates, highlighting the importance of awareness and informed healthcare decisions.
- 🌍 **Regional Disparities**: Counties like Turkana and Mandera have higher child mortality rates compared to Nairobi and Mombasa, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset includes information on:
- 📅 Year-wise child mortality trends
- 📍 County-specific mortality rates
- 🏥 Availability of healthcare services
- 🍽️ Nutritional factors
